# Morse Codifier

## Overview

Morse Codifier is a simple Python application that converts user input into Morse code. The Morse code definitions are dynamically fetched from Wikipedia.

## Features

- Fetches Morse code definitions from Wikipedia.
- Converts a given text input into corresponding Morse code.

## Usage

1. **Run the main script:**

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Enter the text you want to convert to Morse code:**

    The program will prompt you to input the text you want to convert. After entering the text, it will display the corresponding Morse code for each character.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that handles user input and converts it to Morse code.
- `get_morse_codes.py`: A script that fetches Morse code definitions from Wikipedia and stores them in a dictionary.
